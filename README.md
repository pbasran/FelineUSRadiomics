This contains a single MAT file that contains results from all the ML models and datasets used in the following study (https://osf.io/auf5c/). 
The mat files containt
- each simulation run with each dataset and type of classification model 
- All the data in stored for each simulation stored at variable T (along with train / validation datasets)
- Top features from the Wrapper and Decision Tree feature selections algorithms
- the tables for average performances of all models and datasets
- and the models themselves.

Each are stored as structures.
